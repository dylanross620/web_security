1. This lab will dump a stack trace if you navigate to the `/product` endpoint with the GET parameter `productId=x` where `x` is some input that isn't a valid integer. This leaks the server software in use, which is `Apache Struts 2 2.3.31`
2. This lab has an HTML comment on the homepage that links to the debugging endpoint at `/cgi-bin/phpinfo.php`. By navigating to that page, you can see various information including the environment variables
3. This lab mentions a `/backup` endpoint in its `robots.txt` file. By navigating there, you can access a backup of the source code, which includes the hardcoded database password
4. This lab accepts and responds to HTTP TRACE requests. By sending one to the home page, you can see that a custom `X-Custom-IP-Authorization` header is added to the request with your IP address as the value. Navigating to the `/admin` endpoint, it says that the interface is accessible to local users. By navigating to `/admin` and adding the `X-Custom-IP-Authorization` header with a value of `127.0.0.1`, we can pass the check and gain access to the admin interface
5. This lab exposes the version control history at the `/.git` endpoint. By downloading this, the source code can be recovered by running `git checkout -- .`. I was unable to recover commit diffs because files on the server were corrupted
